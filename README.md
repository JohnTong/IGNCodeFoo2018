2 - For the Eiffel Tower, here is my method for possibly recreating it in Geomags. First, the frame: the Eiffel Tower is 325 meters tall, and one Geomag rod + one Geomag magnet is .00397 meters long, which means to construct the frame, we have 325 / .00397 * 16 ~= 1.3 x 10^6 Geomags. Next, I would want Geomags to connect each of the legs sides to make squares at each magnet. So, the legs are approximately 50.56 meters long, therefore, 50.56 / .00397 * 16 * 65000 = 1.32 x 10^11. Lastly, I'd make little triangles between each square for support, so another 1.3 x 10^11 Geomags. So, approximately 3 x 10^11 Geomags rods and magnets.
